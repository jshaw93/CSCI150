# Displays initials in block format using a Multi-line String and Print function
# Multi-line strings are a type of string that can, as the name suggests, use multiple lines.
# These are useful for formatting strings in a way that is easier and faster to code than doing multiple print
# methods or have a massive single line using newline characters "\n" to create newlines.
# They are also used to give developers context on where to use certain bits of code that I hope we'll cover
# later in the semester.

# To make a Multi-line string, you encompass the string with three sets of quotations.
